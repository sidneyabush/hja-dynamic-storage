================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================
1. Site-level estimate = ONE value per site (not annual time series)
2. Annual = one value per year per site
3. GSWS06 has hydrometric data but NO chemistry or isotope data
4. Non-hydrometric sites (MR NC LC LO2 CC LO1) only have isotope data from 2022-2023
5. Water Year (WY) = October 1 to September 30 (e.g. WY 1997 = Oct 1996 - Sep 1997)
6. For manuscript analyses we use WY 1997-2020 for hydrometric metrics
7. MTT values are means across available methods (MTTM column in source data)
8. Fyw values are means of low (FYWL) and high (FYWH) estimates (FYWM column)
9. DR values are overall means across methods (DR_Overall column)
10. CHS excludes GSWS09 and GSLOOK (no specific conductance measurements)
